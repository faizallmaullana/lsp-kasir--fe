🔧 IMAGE UPLOAD TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
====================================

❌ PROBLEM: Your payload shows:
{
  is_available: true, 
  item_name: "woy tes2", 
  item_type: "food", 
  price: 12
}

✅ EXPECTED: Should include image_base64:
{
  is_available: true, 
  item_name: "woy tes2", 
  item_type: "food", 
  price: 12,
  image_base64: "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUg...",
  image_type: "image/png"
}

🔍 DEBUGGING STEPS:
==================

1. OPEN BROWSER CONSOLE (F12)
2. GO TO ITEMS PAGE (/items)
3. CLICK "Tambah Produk" 
4. CLICK "Debug Form" button to see current form state
5. MAKE SURE "Upload File" tab is selected (not "URL Gambar")
6. CLICK the upload area to select an image file
7. CHECK CONSOLE for "🖼️ IMAGE UPLOAD EVENT TRIGGERED"
8. VERIFY file validation passes
9. CLICK "Debug Form" again to see if image_file is set
10. CLICK "Test Base64" button (should appear if image is loaded)
11. FILL IN required fields (name, price)
12. CLICK "Simpan Produk" and check console for payload

📋 CONSOLE CHECKS TO DO:
========================

After selecting image, you should see:
✅ "🖼️ IMAGE UPLOAD EVENT TRIGGERED"
✅ "📁 File details: {name: ..., size: ..., type: ...}"
✅ "✅ Validation result: {isValid: true, errors: []}"
✅ "✅ Image validation passed, calling setImageFile..."
✅ "✅ Image file set in form: File{...}"

In form debug, you should see:
✅ "image_file: File{name: '...', size: ..., type: '...'}"
✅ "image_preview: 'data:image/...;base64,...'"

Before API call, you should see:
✅ "🔍 IMAGE DEBUG INFO: Has image_file? true"
✅ "Upload method is file? true"
✅ "Processing file upload for base64 conversion..."
✅ "Base64 conversion successful: {content_type: '...', data_length: ...}"

🚨 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES:
=========================

ISSUE: "setImageFile is not a function"
FIX: Make sure useItemForm() exports setImageFile function

ISSUE: "Upload method is url not file"  
FIX: Click "Upload File" tab before selecting image

ISSUE: "Has image_file? false"
FIX: Make sure file input change event is firing and validation passes

ISSUE: "File validation failed"
FIX: Use supported image formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP) under 5MB

ISSUE: "Base64 conversion failed"
FIX: Check browser console for FileReader errors

🧪 MANUAL TEST:
===============
Run this in console to test image selection manually:

const input = document.createElement('input');
input.type = 'file';
input.accept = 'image/*';
input.onchange = (e) => {
  const file = e.target.files[0];
  console.log('Manual test file:', file);
  // This should show your file details
};
input.click();

📞 NEXT STEPS:
==============
1. Follow the debugging steps above
2. Report which step fails
3. Share the console output from each step
4. We'll fix the specific issue blocking image upload
